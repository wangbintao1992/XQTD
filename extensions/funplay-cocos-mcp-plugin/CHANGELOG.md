# Changelog

All notable changes to Funplay MCP for Cocos will be documented in this file.

This project follows a simple changelog format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and uses semantic versioning when releases are tagged.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.3] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Fixed `Object.hasOwn is not a function` in older Cocos Creator editor runtimes (reported on 3.8.3), affecting Configure + Skills, JSONC configuration, and project prompts. Use compatible own-property checks while retaining duplicate-key validation and concurrent-edit protection. Contributed in [#21](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/pull/21).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added OpenCode one-click MCP configuration and project-local Skills support (`.opencode/skills`), contributed in [#19](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/pull/19).
- OpenCode configuration reads and updates JSON/JSONC with comments and trailing commas, preserves unrelated text and settings, and rejects malformed or duplicate-key configurations without overwriting them.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Fixed Game View preview started through MCP leaving the native toolbar in a stopped or wrong-platform state, which disabled manual pause controls. Preview starts and mode changes now use the toolbar's own logic, repair legacy state mismatches, and verify the actual preview state.
- Routed `pause_runtime` and `resume_runtime` to the Game View preview controller instead of the edit-scene director. Repeated start/pause/resume calls are idempotent; stopped previews, rejected operations, busy or unavailable toolbars now report explicit errors.
- `get_runtime_state` and scene validation now report Game View running/paused state and toolbar synchronization. Edit-scene frame/time-scale counters remain in performance snapshots and are explicitly labeled to avoid confusing them with preview state.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Added isolated per-script console capture for editor/scene execution and compatibility aliases. Logs survive failures and remain available when MCP console printing is disabled; optional execution metadata preserves existing tool return data.
- Added a project-persisted Print MCP logs toggle in Settings. It immediately controls extension and HTTP server console printing, including startup messages, while preserving Recent Activity, internal diagnostics, and live MCP connections.
- Added project-derived default ports and project-specific MCP entry names. Existing fixed-port configurations remain compatible; temporary fallback endpoints must be pinned before one-click configuration.
- Added per-client Project Skills installation, status, diff, backup, and restore for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Qoder, and Kimi Code. Codex now uses `.agents/skills`, with protected migration of legacy `.codex/skills` built-ins.
- Added parameterized project workflows from `mcp-prompts/*.md`, refreshed on list/get, with required-argument validation, bounded file discovery, and visible parse warnings.

### Changed

- Recent Activity now preserves result hierarchy, array items, and scalar values instead of selecting six flattened fields. Script cards separate summaries, execution logs, and return values; expandable branches survive refreshes, and large/sensitive results stay bounded and redacted.
- Redesigned MCP Server, Tool Exposure, Settings, and Project Skills with consistent headings, aligned controls, lightweight sections, and responsive layouts. Skills show only available actions with file/backup details collapsed; extension update controls are in Settings.
- Removed all Output sections and the standalone Activity/log-viewing window and menu, while retaining the dashboard's Recent Activity with bounded result previews. Clear removes only interaction history. Action notices preserve success/failure feedback; backend diagnostic tools and resources are unchanged.
- Added Configure + Skills for supported clients, installing only missing built-ins and preserving existing or locally modified copies, including when files change during setup.
- One-click configuration preserves other projects and manually repointed entries, checks for concurrent edits, and writes configuration atomically. Claude Code entries are scoped to the nearest Git root.
- Dashboard Skills notices now follow the selected supported client. Project Skills includes a client selector and explicit managed-directory paths.

### Fixed

- Fixed [#18](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/issues/18): corrected the built-in UI Skill's UI system overview link to the working Cocos Creator 3.8 manual URL, while retaining valid component reference links. Upgraded the UI Skill template to v2 and preserved recognition of unmodified v1 installs as updateable, including those without managed metadata.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added one-click MCP client configuration for Qoder and Kimi Code, including their documented custom configuration-directory environment variables.
- Added a dashboard alert that names built-in project Skills that are not installed, have updates available, or contain local modifications, with a direct link to Project Skills management.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Normalize every cloned node produced by `create_prefab_from_node` to Cocos Creator's `UI_2D` layer (`33554432`) before serialization, while leaving the source scene hierarchy unchanged.
- Reject generated Prefab content whose serialized `cc.Node._layer` values do not match `UI_2D` before writing the asset.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Added a dedicated **Project Skills** panel for listing project-local Codex skills, independently installing and updating both built-in Funplay skills, previewing template differences, backing up updates, restoring the latest backup, and creating custom skills.
- Added the built-in `funplay-cocos-ui-composition` Skill for Cocos-native responsive UI work across `UITransform`, `Widget`, `SafeArea`, `Layout`, scrolling, text, input, animation, prefabs, and performance validation.
- Added managed per-Skill template version/hash metadata so MCP upgrades can report built-in Skill updates without silently replacing local changes.

### Changed

- Generate project Skills with standard `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description`.
- Expanded `funplay-cocos-mcp-workflow` from a short checklist into a complete inspect/edit/readback/diagnostics/preview workflow adapted from the proven Funplay Unity MCP Skill structure.
- Preserve existing UI and gameplay-object Prefabs by default, editing only necessary nodes/components unless a full rebuild is explicitly requested.

### Fixed

- Fixed [#17](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/issues/17): `create_prefab_from_node` now assigns unique `cc.PrefabInfo` and `cc.CompPrefabInfo` metadata before serialization and rejects incomplete output, allowing generated Prefabs to open in Cocos Creator's Prefab editor.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Added a checksum-verified **Install for All Projects** workflow that installs the latest release into the active Cocos Creator version's managed global extension directory, asks Creator to scan and register it without replacing a running project copy, detects conflicts, and makes it automatically available to projects opened with that Creator version.

### Fixed

- Targeted Cocos Creator 3.8's version-scoped `builtin-extensions/<version>` directory instead of the legacy user extension path.
- Kept the active project copy running after global registration so MCP Settings can report the installed global version and duplicate-copy guidance without being unloaded mid-install.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Fixed [#6](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/issues/6): browser preview results now default `url` and `localUrl` to a same-host loopback address while preserving Cocos Creator's reported LAN address in `networkUrl` and `reportedUrl`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Fixed [#5](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/issues/5): create and verify genuinely linked Prefab instances, include the required `cc.Prefab` node type, and clean up nodes that fail post-creation linkage checks.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added English and Chinese localization for extension menus, panel titles, controls, status messages, prompts, and empty states.
- Added a project-level language setting with `Auto / 跟随 Cocos Creator`, `中文`, and `English` options.
- Added Chinese descriptions and localized profile labels for all 105 tools shown in the Tool Exposure window while preserving MCP tool IDs and schemas in English.

### Optimized

- Kept the four focused management windows on one shared localization layer so language changes remain consistent across dashboard, tool exposure, settings, and activity workflows.
- Prevented interface-only configuration changes, including language selection, from rebuilding MCP runtime state or clearing activity logs.

### Fixed

- Fixed 12-hour timestamps such as `11:37:12 PM` overlapping tool names in the Activity window.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added `get_preview_mode` and `set_preview_mode` with explicit `browser`, `gameView`, and `simulator` semantics.

### Changed

- Reworked `run_project_preview` to use the Cocos Creator 3.8.x preview APIs, return the effective mode and browser preview URL, and retain `platform` as a deprecated alias for `mode`.

### Fixed

- Fixed [#3](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp/issues/3): restored preview launch on Cocos Creator 3.8.8 by replacing the nonexistent `preview.start`, `preview.open-preview`, and `builder.preview` messages.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added `create_scene` to the default `core` profile for creating an empty scene or copying the active scene directly to an assets path without an interactive save dialog.

### Optimized

- Expanded the default `core` profile to 38 tools and the `full` profile to 103 tools, with synchronized English, Chinese, and generated tool documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed `run_script_diagnostics` returning `spawn EINVAL` on Windows by running the TypeScript compiler script through Node instead of launching `tsc.cmd` directly.
- Fixed TypeScript diagnostics inside Cocos Creator incorrectly treating the Creator executable as a normal Node runtime, which could report a false successful result without running `tsc`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added `create_prefab_from_node`, a Cocos Creator 3.8.x-friendly prefab creation tool that serializes a scene node in the scene process and persists the prefab through asset-db instead of relying on the brittle `scene:create-prefab` message.
- Added automatic release checks and panel actions for opening the latest GitHub Release or installing a verified update package.
- Added a checksum-verified one-click updater that downloads the release zip, verifies `SHA256SUMS.txt`, backs up the current extension, replaces package files, and reloads the extension when the Cocos package API supports it.
- Added focused Cocos panel windows for Tool Exposure, MCP Settings, and Activity & Logs, with the main MCP Server panel reduced to a dashboard-style workflow.
- Added a Unity MCP-style Tool Exposure window with grouped tool lists, per-tool toggles, category select/clear actions, and a single-card Recent Activity stream with status badges.

### Fixed

- Treat undefined editor message responses as inconclusive for prefab creation and verify the resulting prefab file/asset before reporting success.
- Refuse one-click updates for symlink or git-worktree extension installs so local development checkouts are not overwritten accidentally.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added project identity metadata to `/health` and MCP `initialize` responses so clients and duplicate listeners can verify the active Cocos project safely.
- Added same-project listener attach behavior before port fallback, preventing accidental attachment to a different Cocos project on the same port.
- Added default-on JavaScript safety checks for `execute_javascript`, `execute_scene_script`, and `execute_editor_script`, with per-call `safety_checks` overrides.
- Added named tool profiles in the Cocos panel, including save, apply, delete, import, and export workflows.
- Added category-level tool exposure controls in the panel for quick enable, disable, and clear actions.
- Added asset dependency tools: `inspect_asset_dependencies` and `validate_asset_dependencies`.
- Added Cocos project/editor tools: `get_build_status`, `open_build_panel`, `run_project_preview`, `save_current_scene`, `get_editor_preference`, `set_editor_preference`, and `broadcast_editor_message`.
- Added Button event binding tools: `list_button_click_events` and `bind_button_click_event`.
- Added `create_cocos_mcp_project_skill` for generating a recommended local Codex workflow skill.
- Added release package sensitive-content scanning for npm/GitHub/MCP token-like values and private keys.

### Optimized

- Improved tool exposure UX for larger projects by making custom profiles reusable and shareable.
- Expanded generated tool documentation and README coverage for the new 37-tool `core` profile and 101-tool `full` profile.
- Improved release packaging confidence with checksum verification and content scanning.

### Changed

- Expanded the default `core` profile from 34 tools to 37 tools.
- Expanded the `full` profile from 89 tools to 101 tools.
- Split more tool implementations into focused modules under `lib/tools/`, including advanced assets, Cocos project/editor helpers, and scene event helpers.
- Persisted `executeJavascriptSafetyChecks`, active tool profile names, and saved tool profiles in project configuration.

### Fixed

- Fixed the GitHub Release workflow so release pages use generated English changelog-style `RELEASE_NOTES.md` instead of the artifact installation README.
- Fixed release package scanning false positives around normal MCP server config names while preserving credential detection.

### Security

- Added guardrails for JavaScript execution against obvious risky file-system and shell patterns, including delete/truncate calls, raw writable streams, path traversal, user/system absolute paths, and `child_process`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added generated tool reference documentation in `docs/TOOLS.md`.
- Added `docs:generate` and `docs:check` scripts to keep tool counts, profiles, categories, and descriptions synchronized with `lib/tool-registry.js`.
- Added a read-only `GET /tools` debug endpoint with curl examples for quick local troubleshooting.
- Added panel activity previews for recent tool calls and runtime logs.
- Added panel curl copy actions for `/health` and `/tools`.

### Optimized

- Added CI and release validation for generated tool documentation.
- Improved the MCP client config panel so the preview follows the selected client target.
- Improved the panel information architecture around troubleshooting and maintenance: version, update status, tool profile, client config, recent calls, and logs.

### Changed

- Refined tool category inference so `get_tool_catalog` is grouped with project/context tools.
- Split file-system tools and asset refresh helpers into `lib/tools/files.js` as the first registry modularization step.

### Fixed

- No runtime bug fixes in this release; this release focuses on product polish, debugging ergonomics, and maintainability.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added an npm-installable `funplay-cocos-mcp` stdio wrapper that bridges MCP clients to the local Cocos HTTP endpoint.
- Added MCP Registry metadata in `server.json`, including npm package ownership metadata via `mcpName`.
- Added wrapper tests, npm pack dry-run verification, and registry validation scripts.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added a documented release workflow and release checklist for Cocos extension publishing.

- Added `custom` tool exposure with per-category and per-tool include/exclude configuration.
- Added `get_tool_catalog`, `check_for_updates`, `get_recent_logs`, `search_project_logs`, `clear_logs`, and `validate_scene`.
- Added MCP log resources: `cocos://logs/editor` and `cocos://logs/project`.
- Added in-memory runtime logs alongside the existing MCP interaction history.
- Added optional Streamable HTTP session support via `enableSessions` and `Mcp-Session-Id`.

### Changed

- Updated the Cocos panel to show installed version, update status, session toggle, and tool exposure controls.
- Tightened Streamable HTTP behavior for `Accept` headers, JSON-RPC notifications/responses, `202 Accepted`, unsupported GET/SSE requests, and DELETE session termination.

### Fixed

- Improved project log tailing so trailing blank lines do not hide the last useful log entries.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Fixed CI test expectations after expanding the documented `core` and `full` tool profiles.
- Aligned the latest release line with the current tested `main` branch state.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added `get_editor_state` as a compact structured editor-state summary tool.
- Added `get_selection` and `set_selection` as explicit selection workflow tools for editor-side automation.
- Added persistence for the selected one-click MCP client target in the Cocos panel configuration.

### Changed

- Expanded the default `core` profile from 19 tools to 22 tools by promoting editor-state and selection workflows.
- Expanded the `full` profile from 67 tools to 70 tools.
- Updated panel config persistence so changing the selected MCP client target no longer restarts the server unnecessarily.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added Node.js unit tests for MCP protocol negotiation, tool profile exports, tool execution errors, and project file path safety.

### Changed

- Updated the MCP initialize response to negotiate protocol version `2025-11-25` by default while retaining compatibility with older supported protocol versions.
- Added `structuredContent` to tool call results when a tool returns structured JSON data.
- Changed tool execution failures to return MCP tool errors instead of JSON-RPC internal errors, improving client-side self-correction.
- Updated CI to run the new Node.js test suite.

### Security

- Restricted project file and asset-path resources to paths inside the active Cocos project root.
- Added HTTP request body size limits and invalid `Origin` header rejection for the embedded MCP server.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

- Added actual-running-port reporting in MCP server status and panel state.
- Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` for repository contribution guidance.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for lightweight GitHub validation.
- Added a lightweight GitHub Star promotion log after successful MCP server startup.

### Changed

- Updated the MCP panel status line to show configured-port to actual-port fallback information.
- Updated the English and Chinese README files to document automatic port fallback behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed VS Code one-click configuration to use platform-specific config paths with macOS fallback behavior.
- Fixed Windows one-click MCP configuration path resolution by using a more reliable home/appdata lookup strategy.
