Funplay MCP for Cocos is an MIT-licensed Cocos Creator extension that embeds an HTTP MCP server directly inside the editor. It lets AI assistants such as Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, VS Code Copilot, Trae, Kiro, Qoder, Kimi Code, and OpenCode inspect and operate your running Cocos project.

The package follows the same product direction as Funplay MCP for Unity: keep the default tool surface focused, provide a one-click client configuration window, and make one high-flexibility execution tool the primary workflow.

For Cocos, the primary tool is `execute_javascript`:

- `context: "scene"` runs JavaScript in the active Cocos scene/runtime context
- `context: "editor"` runs JavaScript in the Cocos editor/browser context

> *"Create a login page UI with account/password fields and a main login button."*
>
> Your AI assistant can call `execute_javascript`, build the UI hierarchy under the active Canvas, attach Cocos components, inspect the result, and capture a screenshot for validation.

## Quick Start

If you just want to connect quickly, do these three things:

- Install this repository as a Cocos Creator extension
- Open `Funplay > MCP Server`
- Use the built-in one-click MCP client configuration

### 1. Install as a Cocos Creator Extension

Recommended install: use the official [Cocos Store page](https://store.cocos.com/app/detail/8913) and install the extension into your target Cocos Creator project.

For local development or unreleased builds, clone or copy this repository into your Cocos project extension directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-cocos-project
mkdir -p extensions
git clone https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-cocos-mcp.git extensions/funplay-cocos-mcp
```

Then restart Cocos Creator or reload extensions from the editor.

For a non-git install, download `Funplay.CocosMcp.v<version>.zip` from the GitHub Releases page, unzip it, and move the extracted `funplay-cocos-mcp` folder into your project `extensions/` directory.

#### Install for All Projects (Recommended)

Install and open the extension in any project first. Then open `Funplay > MCP Settings` and click **Install for All Projects** in the All Projects section. The extension downloads the latest GitHub Release, verifies `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and installs it into the active Cocos Creator version's managed global extension directory:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.CocosCreator/builtin-extensions/<Creator version>/funplay-cocos-mcp`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.CocosCreator\builtin-extensions\<Creator version>\funplay-cocos-mcp`

Cocos Creator scans and registers the installed copy immediately. Projects opened or created with that Creator version then load it automatically, and the MCP server keeps its default autostart behavior. Reopen an already-running project if its project-level copy has priority. No extension files are copied into each project's `extensions/` directory.

Global extensions are isolated by Cocos Creator version. If you use multiple Creator versions, run **Install for All Projects** once from each version.

The installer does not delete the current project copy, which protects development worktrees. If both copies exist, MCP Settings shows a duplicate-install warning. After confirming that the global copy works, remove or disable the project copy to avoid extension conflicts.

### 2. Start the MCP Server

Open the editor menu:

```text
Funplay > MCP Server
```

New projects get a stable project-derived port in `20000–29999`. Existing saved configurations keep their fixed port (including `8765`). Use the exact URL shown in MCP Server; if a temporary fallback port is active, click **Pin Current Port** or **Use Per-Project Port** before configuring a client.

If the configured port is already occupied, the extension first checks whether the existing listener belongs to the same Cocos project. Same-project listeners are reused safely; unrelated listeners trigger automatic fallback to the next available local port.

The panel is intentionally small:

- Enable or disable the MCP server
- Open focused Tool Exposure, MCP Settings, and Project Skills windows
- Automatically check the installed version against the latest GitHub release
- Open the release page or install verified release packages from the panel
- Install once in the Cocos Creator global extensions directory so existing and new projects can use it automatically
- Configure AI clients with one click and preview the selected client config
- Keep advanced tool profile editing, transport settings, and installation management out of the main server window
- Follow the Cocos Creator interface language automatically, or select Chinese/English per project in MCP Settings
- Toggle **Print MCP logs** in Settings to silence MCP console messages without losing Recent Activity or internal diagnostics

All management pages use consistent headings, aligned controls, and lightweight sections. Tool Exposure groups per-tool toggles by category; Project Skills highlights available actions and folds away file paths and backups. Recent Activity shows each call's summary and actual result as an expandable object/array tree, with execution logs and return values in separate sections for scripts. Output sections and the standalone log-viewing panel are removed. Short action notices preserve success/failure feedback, while diagnostic logs remain available to MCP tools and resources.

Script tools capture per-call `console.log/info/warn/error/debug` output, including logs before a failure, independently of **Print MCP logs**. Capture is isolated across concurrent and nested calls and stops when the script settles; global/project logs and logs from separately required modules are not collected. Use the injected `console` (also available as `env.console` in `run`/module exports). MCP responses retain their existing `data` shape and add optional `execution` metadata with context, duration, bounded/redacted logs, and an omitted-entry count. Recent Activity preserves result hierarchy and scalar values; large results and file/script bodies remain limited or omitted, with truncation notices.

The extension menu and native panel titles follow the Cocos Creator interface language. Panel controls, tool descriptions, status messages, prompts, and empty states support English and Chinese; open `Funplay > MCP Settings` to follow Creator or set a project-specific content-language override. MCP tool IDs and schemas remain in English so client integrations stay stable.

### 3. Configure Your AI Client

Use the built-in **MCP Client Config** section in the `Funplay > MCP Server` panel first.

Select your target client, click **One-Click Configure**, and the extension writes the recommended MCP config entry for you.

The MCP server name written to clients is:

```text
cocos-<project>-<hash>
```

If you prefer to edit config files manually, use the examples below as fallback references. Replace their legacy `funplay_cocos` name and `8765` port with the name and URL shown in your panel. One-click Claude Code configuration uses the project's Git-root scope in `~/.claude.json`, not the global example below. See [project setup and migration](docs/PROJECT_WORKFLOWS.md).

The global config lives in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/opencode.json` or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` on every platform (`opencode.jsonc` also works).

One-click configuration prefers an existing `opencode.jsonc`. It supports comments and trailing commas in either file, preserves unrelated settings and comments, and leaves malformed or ambiguous configurations unchanged.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "funplay_cocos": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Optional: npm stdio Wrapper

If your MCP client prefers a local `stdio` command, install the npm wrapper after starting the Cocos editor server:

```bash
npm install -g funplay-cocos-mcp
```

Example MCP client entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "funplay_cocos": {
      "command": "funplay-cocos-mcp",
      "env": {
        "FUNPLAY_COCOS_MCP_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The wrapper bridges stdio MCP traffic to the embedded Cocos HTTP endpoint. You can also run it with `npx funplay-cocos-mcp --url http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.

### 4. Verify the Connection

Open your AI client and try a few safe requests first:

- "Call `get_project_info` and summarize the current Cocos project."
- "Read `cocos://project/context` and tell me the editor status."
- "Use `execute_javascript` with `context: \"scene\"` to return the active scene name."
- "Use `execute_javascript` with `context: \"editor\"` to return the project path."

If these work, the MCP server, resources, prompts, and primary execution tool are connected correctly.

For local transport debugging, the panel can copy these commands, or you can run them directly:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/tools
```

### 5. Start Building

Try a higher-level prompt in your AI client:

> Create a login page UI in the current Cocos scene with account/password fields, a login button, and a guest-login button. Use `execute_javascript` first, inspect the hierarchy, then capture a screenshot.

## Before You Start

- This extension is **Editor-only**. It is meant to automate Cocos Creator, not to add runtime dependencies to your final game build.
- New projects use a project-derived port. The MCP Server dashboard shows the exact endpoint and supports pinning a fixed port.
- If the configured port is busy, the server automatically falls back to the next available port and the panel/client config use the actual running port.
- `GET /health` and `GET /tools` are read-only debug endpoints for quick local checks outside an MCP client.
- The default `core` profile exposes 39 high-signal tools. Switch to `full` for all 105 tools, or use `custom` to include/exclude tool categories and individual tools.
- The panel checks GitHub releases automatically and also supports manual checks.
- One-click update downloads the GitHub Release zip, verifies `SHA256SUMS.txt`, backs up the current extension, replaces the package files, and reloads the extension when the Cocos package API supports it. If reload is unavailable, restart Cocos Creator after installation. Git worktree and symlink installs are intentionally left to manual `git pull` or package replacement.
- **Install for All Projects** uses the same release and SHA256 verification flow, targets the active Creator version's managed global directory, then asks Creator to scan and register the package. It preserves an active project copy instead of switching packages underneath an open settings window; the global copy is enabled immediately when no project copy is active, or on the next project open otherwise.
- **Project Skills** manages the built-in `funplay-cocos-mcp-workflow` and `funplay-cocos-ui-composition` skills plus custom skills for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Qoder, and Kimi Code. Select a client to see its managed directory, versions, diffs, local modifications, backups, and restore actions. Legacy Codex built-ins can migrate to `.agents/skills` without deleting their original files.
- Streamable HTTP responses follow the MCP transport requirements for `Accept`, `MCP-Protocol-Version`, JSON-RPC notifications/responses, and optional `Mcp-Session-Id` sessions.
- Tool listings include MCP `outputSchema` and `annotations`; structured tool results use a standard envelope with `ok`, `tool`, `callId`, `summary`, `data`, and follow-up `refs`.
- `execute_javascript` safety checks are enabled by default. They block obvious risky filesystem and shell patterns such as delete/truncate calls, raw writable streams, path traversal, user/system absolute paths, and `child_process`. This is a guardrail, not a full sandbox; a call can explicitly pass `safety_checks: false` when you have reviewed the risk.
- All exposed MCP tools execute directly. There is no extra approval toggle inside the Cocos extension.
- File tools and `cocos://asset/path/...` resources are restricted to the active Cocos project root.
- The recommended workflow is `execute_javascript` first, then focused helper tools for screenshots, diagnostics, assets, and inspection.
- If you change the server port or tool exposure in the panel, the extension saves the config and restarts the server when needed.

## Why This Project

- **`execute_javascript` First** — One high-flexibility JavaScript tool can orchestrate scene/runtime work and editor-side automation without flooding AI clients with too many narrow tool calls
- **Embedded Cocos Extension** — No separate Python daemon or external bridge process is required for the Cocos-side plugin
- **One-Click Client Configuration** — Configure Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Trae, Kiro, Qoder, Kimi Code, Codex, and OpenCode directly from Cocos Creator
- **Project Context Built In** — Exposes live project, scene, selection, script diagnostics, logs, and interaction-history resources
- **Focused by Default, Full When Needed** — `core` reduces tool-list noise; `full` exposes every available tool; `custom` plus saved profiles lets you tune and restore tool exposure by category or tool
- **Visual Validation** — Scene/editor/preview screenshots and input simulation help AI verify UI and gameplay changes

## Highlights

- **105 Built-in Tools** — Scene hierarchy, editor state, selection workflows, prefabs, assets, asset dependencies, project instructions, UI creation, components, files, logs, script diagnostics, screenshots, runtime control, build/preview helpers, editor preferences, event binding, and input simulation
- **Primary Unified Tool** — `execute_javascript` supports both `scene` and `editor` contexts
- **Resources & Prompts** — Live project/log resources plus reusable workflows like script fixing, scene validation, and playable prototype creation
- **Cocos Panel UI** — A compact `Funplay > MCP Server` dashboard plus focused Tool Exposure, MCP Settings, and Project Skills windows for larger workflows
- **Screenshot and Input Support** — Capture editor/scene/game/preview screenshots and send Electron-level mouse/keyboard events
- **Vendor Agnostic** — Works with any AI client that supports MCP over HTTP JSON-RPC

## Relationship to Funplay MCP for Unity

Funplay MCP for Cocos follows the same design principles as Funplay MCP for Unity, adapted to Cocos Creator's JavaScript/TypeScript editor environment.

| Area | Funplay MCP for Cocos | Funplay MCP for Unity |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Editor integration | Cocos Creator extension | Unity Editor package |
| Embedded server | Built-in HTTP MCP server | Built-in HTTP MCP server |
| Primary execution tool | `execute_javascript` | `execute_code` |
| Primary language | JavaScript in scene/editor contexts | C# in Unity editor/runtime contexts |
| Default profile | `core` with 39 tools | `core` focused tool profile |
| Full profile | 105 tools plus `custom` exposure | 79 tools |
| Client setup | One-click config panel | One-click config window |

## MCP Capabilities

The current package exposes four capability layers:

- **Tools** — 39 tools in `core`, 105 tools in `full`, plus `custom` include/exclude rules and saved tool profiles
- **Primary execution** — `execute_javascript` for scene/runtime and editor/browser automation
- **Prompts** — `fix_script_errors`, `create_playable_prototype`, `scene_validation`, and `auto_wire_scene`, plus parameterized project workflows loaded from `mcp-prompts/*.md`. See [project isolation, Skills and workflow setup](docs/PROJECT_WORKFLOWS.md).
- **Resources** — project context, scene summaries, current selection, script diagnostics, asset selection, logs, and MCP interaction history

For the generated tool reference, including categories, profiles, and read/mutation hints, see [docs/TOOLS.md](./docs/TOOLS.md).

The default `core` set is intentionally small: `execute_javascript`, `execute_scene_script`, `execute_editor_script`, `get_editor_state`, `get_tool_catalog`, `check_for_updates`, `get_selection`, `list_project_instructions`, `read_project_instruction`, `set_selection`, `get_project_info`, `get_build_status`, `get_preview_mode`, `create_scene`, `get_scene_info`, `get_hierarchy`, `list_scenes`, `open_scene`, `inspect_prefab`, `validate_prefab_references`, `inspect_prefab_instance`, `list_assets`, `inspect_asset`, `inspect_asset_dependencies`, `validate_asset_dependencies`, `open_asset`, `select_asset`, `run_script_diagnostics`, `get_recent_logs`, `search_project_logs`, `clear_logs`, `validate_scene`, `get_performance_snapshot`, `get_script_diagnostic_context`, `get_runtime_state`, `capture_editor_screenshot`, `capture_scene_screenshot`, `capture_preview_screenshot`, and `list_editor_windows`.

### Preview Modes

Creator 3.8.x preview automation uses the same modes and editor APIs as the built-in preview toolbar:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `browser` | Opens the scene in the system browser; `get_preview_mode` and `run_project_preview` return same-host and network preview URLs when available. |
| `gameView` | Starts the scene inside Cocos Creator's Game View. |
| `simulator` | Starts the scene in the native simulator. |

Use `get_preview_mode` to inspect the active mode, `set_preview_mode` to switch it, and `run_project_preview` to start it. `run_project_preview` still accepts `platform` as a deprecated alias for `mode`.

Game View starts through the native preview toolbar so its manual Pause/Resume buttons remain usable. Repeated starts leave an existing preview running (including its paused state). `pause_runtime` and `resume_runtime` control that same Game View preview and are idempotent; they require a running Game View and do not control browser/simulator previews or the edit-scene director. Switching away from Game View stops it through the toolbar first; rejected operations report an error instead of claiming success.

Enable these control tools in `full` or a custom tool profile. When scripting, prefer them over directly calling `scene.editor-preview-set-play`, which bypasses toolbar synchronization.

`get_runtime_state` (also used by `validate_scene`) reports `scope: "gameView"`, actual `running`/`paused` values, `busy`, and `toolbarSynchronized`. It no longer presents edit-scene frame/time-scale counters as preview state; those remain in `get_performance_snapshot.runtime` with `scope: "editScene"`. `set_time_scale` continues to affect only the edit scene. Preview controls require a compatible, ready Creator main-window toolbar; an unavailable toolbar produces an explicit error.

Browser preview results distinguish same-host automation from LAN access:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `url` / `localUrl` | Loopback URL intended for an MCP client or browser running on the same computer as Cocos Creator. |
| `networkUrl` | Original non-loopback URL for another device on the same network; empty when Creator reports a loopback or wildcard host. |
| `reportedUrl` | Exact URL string reported by Cocos Creator before normalization. |
| `urlWarning` | Non-empty only when the reported value cannot be normalized as an absolute HTTP(S) URL. |

## Built-in Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `cocos://project/context` | Full project and editor context |
| `cocos://project/summary` | Short project summary |
| `cocos://scene/active` | Active scene snapshot |
| `cocos://scene/current` | Alias for the current scene |
| `cocos://selection/current` | Current editor selection |
| `cocos://selection/asset` | Current selected asset |
| `cocos://errors/scripts` | Script diagnostics |
| `cocos://logs/editor` | Recent MCP runtime logs and tool interactions |
| `cocos://logs/project` | Recent tails from common project log files |
| `cocos://mcp/interactions` | Recent MCP interaction history |

## Primary Tool Examples

### Scene Context

```json
{
  "context": "scene",
  "code": "return { sceneName: scene.name, rootCount: scene.children.length };",
  "args": {}
}
```

### Editor Context

```json
{
  "context": "editor",
  "code": "return { projectPath: context.projectPath, toolCount: helpers.listTools().length };",
  "args": {}
}
```

Editor-context scripts receive `Editor`, `fs`, `path`, `os`, `require`, `context`, `args`, and helper functions such as `helpers.getStatus()`, `helpers.listTools()`, `helpers.readResource(uri)`, `helpers.callTool(name, args)`, and `helpers.configureClient(targetId)`.

## Optional Configuration

Place `funplay-cocos-mcp.config.json` in the Cocos project root:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8765,
  "toolProfile": "core",
  "enabledToolCategories": [],
  "disabledToolCategories": [],
  "enabledTools": [],
  "disabledTools": [],
  "enableSessions": false,
  "enableConsoleLogging": true,
  "executeJavascriptSafetyChecks": true,
  "autostart": true,
  "maxInteractionLogEntries": 50,
  "activeToolProfileName": "",
  "savedToolProfiles": []
}
```

Environment variables are also supported:

- `COCOS_MCP_HOST`
- `COCOS_MCP_PORT`
- `COCOS_MCP_PROFILE`

`toolProfile: "custom"` starts from the `core` set, then adds `enabledToolCategories` / `enabledTools` and removes `disabledToolCategories` / `disabledTools`. The panel can save these exposure settings as named `savedToolProfiles` for quick restore or sharing. `enableSessions` is off by default because this server does not need cross-request client state for normal editor automation.

`enableConsoleLogging` defaults to `true`. Turn it off in **MCP Settings > Console Logs > Print MCP logs** to stop the extension and HTTP server from printing MCP information, warnings, and errors to the Cocos console. It takes effect immediately, persists per project, and does not restart MCP, clear history, mute project-script logs, or change stdio protocol output.

The server speaks MCP-style HTTP JSON-RPC 2.0 and supports tools, resources, resource templates, prompts, health checks, and a read-only `/tools` debug endpoint.

## Development

Run checks before publishing changes:

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run docs:check
npm run release:check
npm run pack:dry-run
```

Regenerate the tool reference after changing `lib/tool-registry.js`:

```bash
npm run docs:generate
```

To generate a GitHub Release-ready extension package:

```bash
npm run release:package
```

The package is written to `releases/<version>/` with a zip, manifest, generated release notes, checksum file, and release README. Upload all five files so the public checksums can be verified.
