  '## Operating Loop',
  '',
  '1. Establish context.',
  '   - Read `cocos://project/context` or call `get_editor_state` before assuming the project, active scene, MCP URL, selection, visible windows, or tool profile.',
  '   - Inspect the active scene with `get_scene_info` and `get_hierarchy`; use `get_selection`, `list_scenes`, `list_assets`, or `list_prefabs` when identity or ownership is unclear.',
  '   - Treat user-provided node and asset names as hints. Resolve the real hierarchy path, node UUID, asset UUID, or `db://assets/...` URL before editing.',
  '   - Call `get_tool_catalog` when a required tool may be hidden by the `core`, `full`, or custom exposure profile.',
  '2. Choose the edit surface.',
  '   - Edit TypeScript and ordinary project files with repository tools or the MCP file tools, then refresh the affected asset and run diagnostics.',
  '   - Edit live scene nodes with focused scene/component tools or `execute_javascript` using `context="scene"`; save the scene when the change must persist.',
  '   - Use `execute_javascript` with `context="editor"` for asset-db, Editor messages, project orchestration, and filesystem work that belongs in the editor process.',
  '   - Inspect prefab ownership and references before mutation. Prefer focused prefab tools, or edit a verified linked instance and apply it back through the editor workflow.',
  '   - Preserve an existing UI or gameplay prefab hierarchy and change only the necessary nodes, components, and serialized fields; do not rebuild the entire prefab unless explicitly requested.',
  '3. Execute the smallest coherent change.',
  '   - Prefer one guarded `execute_javascript` operation for tightly related editor work, but use focused tools when they provide clearer validation or safer arguments.',
  '   - Keep JavaScript safety checks enabled unless the code and its paths were reviewed explicitly.',
  '   - Null-check every scene, node, component, asset, and filesystem lookup. Return concise structured before/after values, including stable UUIDs or asset URLs where useful.',
  '   - Save or refresh only the assets and scenes intentionally changed.',
  '   - Do not guess alternate paths, silently create replacement objects, or run self-healing fallback loops after a missing reference or unsupported editor message.',
  '4. Read back and validate.',
  '   - Re-inspect the exact node, component, prefab instance, or asset after mutation; a successful command response alone is not proof of the final editor state.',
  '   - Run `run_script_diagnostics` or `get_script_diagnostic_context` after TypeScript changes, then use `validate_scene` and project logs before claiming success.',
  '   - For visual or runtime work, run the appropriate browser, Game View, or simulator preview and verify with runtime state, input, logs, and screenshots.',
  '   - State exactly what was verified and what still requires a native build, device, network, store, or manual check.',
  '',
  '## Scene, Prefab, and Asset Safety',
  '',
  '- Do not treat Cocos `.scene`, `.prefab`, or `.meta` files as ordinary text. Prefer scene-process, prefab, and asset-db operations that preserve UUID references and editor import state.',
  '- If `edit_prefab_json` is used, target a verified prefab path and the smallest exact JSON path or literal replacement, then run `validate_prefab_references` and inspect the result.',
  '- Before structural prefab work, call `inspect_prefab`; for scene instances, call `inspect_prefab_instance` and choose deliberately between apply and revert.',
  '- Replacing a prefab at the same path can keep the asset UUID while changing internal object IDs and breaking serialized references, animation tracks, nested prefab links, and scene overrides.',
  '- Inspect dependencies with `inspect_asset_dependencies` and validate them with `validate_asset_dependencies` before and after sensitive asset changes.',
  '- Never copy a `.meta` file when duplicating an asset. Use `duplicate_prefab` or asset-db operations so the new asset receives its own UUID.',
  '',
  '## Tool Exposure and Execution Contexts',
  '',
  '- The default `core` profile exposes the main inspection, diagnostics, logs, screenshots, scene, asset, and unified JavaScript workflow.',
  '- The `full` profile adds focused mutation tools for nodes, components, prefabs, UI, runtime control, input simulation, files, and project preview.',
  '- If a named tool is unavailable under a custom profile, adapt to the exposed catalog and report the missing capability instead of pretending it ran.',
  '- In scene context, use the Cocos runtime and scene APIs for live hierarchy and component work. In editor context, use `Editor` APIs and messages for asset-db and extension orchestration.',
  '- Use `execute_scene_script` and `execute_editor_script` only as compatibility entrypoints; prefer `execute_javascript` with an explicit context for new workflows.',
  '',
  '## Script and Asset Validation',
  '',
  '- After external script changes, refresh the affected asset or `db://assets`, then run TypeScript no-emit diagnostics. Use diagnostic context to read focused source snippets before repairing errors.',
  '- Cocos import and compilation are asynchronous. After refresh, re-query diagnostics, logs, or asset info instead of assuming the first request observed the final state.',
  '- Read `get_recent_logs` or `search_project_logs` for import, serialization, preview, and runtime failures. Do not clear persistent project logs without explicit confirmation.',
  '- Use `validate_scene` as a compact final pass, not as a replacement for targeted readback of the values changed.',
  '',
  '## Preview and Runtime Verification',
  '',
  '- Query `get_preview_mode` before changing preview behavior. Use `run_project_preview` only when preview execution is needed and distinguish browser `localUrl` from a LAN `networkUrl`.',
  '- Use `get_runtime_state` for pause, frame, and time-scale state; use focused runtime or component methods only when runtime behavior must be exercised.',
  '- Use `capture_scene_screenshot` for scene-side composition, `capture_preview_screenshot` for game output, and `capture_editor_screenshot` for editor UI or extension panels.',
  '- When low-level input is needed, list editor windows first and target the preview or simulator deliberately. Prefer semantic button events when available.',
  '- Restore temporary runtime state such as pause or time scale before finishing unless the user explicitly wants it left changed.',
  '',
  '## Failure Handling',
  '',
  '- If MCP is unreachable, limit claims to safe filesystem inspection or code edits; do not claim scene, prefab, editor, preview, or runtime verification.',
  '- If a node lookup is ambiguous, return the matching paths and UUIDs and choose only after identifying the user-visible or prefab-owned target.',
  '- If editor readback and serialized text disagree, trust editor and asset-db readback first and investigate whether the wrong asset, scene instance, or stale import was inspected.',
  '- Fix diagnostics or new error logs caused by the change before visual or runtime validation.',

  '| `SafeArea` | Keeping critical controls inside notches and system gesture areas | Put it on the top interaction container; allow full-bleed backgrounds outside it | Applying safe-area insets twice or placing important controls outside the safe rectangle |',
  '| `Layout` | Horizontal, vertical, or grid arrangement and container/child resizing | Choose type, resize mode, padding, spacing, constraint, and start axis; call `updateLayout` only when same-frame measurement is necessary | Putting Layout and Widget on the same node or manually positioning children driven by Layout |',

  '## Design Resolution, Widget, and Safe Area',
  '',
  '- Treat the design resolution as the coordinate baseline, not a physical-device whitelist. Verify the project Fit Width/Fit Height policy and any runtime `view.setDesignResolutionSize` policy before changing layout.',
  '- Use Widget to express attachment and stretch. Use `ON_WINDOW_RESIZE` for resizable desktop/web or large-screen layouts, and use `ALWAYS` only when continuous alignment is worth its property ownership cost.',
  '- When Widget owns an edge or size, change the Widget offsets or align mode rather than writing a Node position or UITransform size that will be overwritten later.',
  '- Keep UI scale at one for ordinary layout. Resize through `UITransform.contentSize`, Widget constraints, Layout properties, or a deliberate design-resolution policy.',
  '- Put decorative backgrounds outside the SafeArea interaction root so they can bleed to physical edges. Put buttons, labels, navigation, and other critical content under SafeArea.',
  '- SafeArea already obtains `sys.getSafeAreaRect` and adjusts through Widget. Do not add a second manual inset unless the project has a documented additional margin.',
  '- Re-evaluate layout on window resize, orientation change, or safe-area change when the target platform can change dimensions at runtime.',
  '',
  '## Portrait and Landscape Patterns',
  '',
  '- For portrait screens, organize persistent UI into Top, flexible Center, and Bottom regions. Let tall screens expand the center instead of multiplying every vertical coordinate by aspect ratio.',
  '- For landscape screens, use Left, Center, Right, and stable corner regions. Verify 16:9, ultrawide, 16:10, and 4:3 instead of treating landscape as one shape.',
  '- Separate camera/world composition from Canvas UI adaptation. A correct Widget layout does not prove the gameplay camera shows the intended world area.',
  '- Use alternate art or deliberate cover/crop behavior when one background cannot preserve composition across phone, tablet, and desktop aspect ratios.',
  '- Reposition only regions whose composition genuinely changes. Do not fork or rebuild the entire screen prefab for a few aspect-dependent offsets.',
  '',
  '## Auto Layout and Dynamic Content',
  '',
  '- A Layout component drives its children or container according to `ResizeMode`. Do not manually write the driven dimensions and expect them to survive the next layout update.',
  '- For `ResizeMode.CHILDREN`, verify the container size and the resulting child sizes. For `ResizeMode.CONTAINER`, verify anchor point and growth direction so the container expands predictably.',
  '- Grid Layout uses its configured cell and constraint policy. Use fixed rows or columns deliberately and do not expect heterogeneous child preferred sizes to define every cell.',
  '- Runtime Layout property changes normally settle on the next frame. Call `updateLayout` only when code must read the final result in the same operation.',
  '- Keep nested Layout chains shallow, batch data changes, pool repeated items, and avoid rebuilding a large hierarchy for every small model update.',
  '',
  '## Sprites, Text, Scrolling, and Input',
  '',
  '- Use sliced SpriteFrames for scalable bordered panels and buttons. Preserve caps/insets and inspect the actual SpriteFrame reference after prefab edits.',
  '- For Label, choose `CLAMP`, `SHRINK`, or `RESIZE_HEIGHT` from a documented overflow policy. `SHRINK` can cost more CPU when text updates; `RESIZE_HEIGHT` transfers height ownership to the label.',
  '- Choose Label cache mode from content behavior: avoid caching assumptions for highly dynamic text, and verify character coverage and atlas capacity for localized content.',
  '- Structure a ScrollView as root, masked view, and content. Enable only the needed direction, verify the content reference, and test child-button cancellation and nested scroll behavior.',
  '- Keep one intentional interactive target per control, bind events once, and validate the serialized target, component, handler, and custom event data.',
  '- Give touch controls a project-defined minimum hit area even when the visible art is smaller. Verify with preview input rather than only inspecting dimensions.',
  '- Synchronize modal visibility, `UIOpacity`, active state, Button interactability, and `BlockInputEvents` so hidden panels neither receive nor leak input.',
  '',
  '## Animation and Prefab Safety',
  '',
  '- Animate a `Visual` or `Container` child when the root is driven by Widget or Layout. Do not animate a property that layout rewrites every frame.',
  '- Stop or cancel an existing tween/animation before replaying it and restore deterministic position, scale, opacity, active state, and input blocking on disable or close.',
  '- Use unscaled scheduling or an explicit UI clock when menus and modal transitions must continue while gameplay time scale is zero.',
  '- Preserve existing prefab objects by default. Replacing a prefab hierarchy can break internal object IDs, animation tracks, serialized component references, nested prefabs, and scene overrides even when the asset UUID remains stable.',
  '- Prefer serialized references and stable semantic names over repeated `getChildByPath` lookups. If a path is required, verify it and fail clearly rather than silently creating an alternate hierarchy.',
  '',
  '## Performance and Validation',
  '',
  '- Profile before restructuring. Common UI costs include excessive nodes, draw-call breaks, masks/stencils, overdraw, dynamic text generation, repeated Layout work, and large unpooled lists.',
  '- Preserve render batching by grouping compatible sprites and materials without changing intended sibling/render order. Use dynamic atlas or static batching only after verifying asset eligibility and runtime behavior.',
  '- Use `get_performance_snapshot` to compare node, component, UI, depth, and memory-oriented counters before and after material changes.',
  '- Validate portrait at 16:9, 19.5:9 or 20:9, a cutout phone, and a portrait tablet. Validate landscape at 16:9, ultrawide, 16:10, 4:3, and both cutout sides.',
  '- In every profile, verify full-bleed art, safe interactive content, text overflow and glyphs, scroll bounds, modal blocking, touch targets, animation interruption, and close/reopen state.',
